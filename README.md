# Battle Cats Game Data

A collection of game data for The Battle Cats

This is used in my battle cats save editor for true forms, talent data, treasure data, etc

The server .pack and .list files were going to be used for a new modding tool, but it now directly downloads the files from the game server. I'm keeping them here because it seems like people use them.

# Battle Cats Game Data

A collection of game data for The Battle Cats

This is used in my [save editor](https://github.com/fieryhenry/BCSFE-Python)
for item names, cat data, treasure data, etc

The server files were going to be used in [tbcml](https://github.com/fieryhenry/TBCModLoader), but it now
directly downloads the files from the game server.
I'm keeping them here because it seems like people use them.
